Raspberry Pi Camera Case
========================

3D printed case for Raspberry Pi, PoE Hat, NeoPixel 24 LED ring and
Raspberry Pi HQ Camera Module & lens.

Includes holes for a switch and 3.5mm jack socket for mode select and NeoPixel
ring connection. 

The switch allows for switching between modes (NDI and local HDMI output)

## Parts list:

- 6mm M2.5 standoffs
- M2.5 pan head screws
- Raspberry Pi 3B+
- PoE Hat (recommend Uctronics mini PoE hat as allows access to the GPIO pins)
- Raspberry Pi HQ Camera Module
- 16mm Telephoto Lens
- Adafruit NeoPixel 24 RGB LED ring
- 30mm 5v fan
- 3.5mm panel mounted jack socket
- 3.5mm male jack to bare end
- On-off switch (panel mounted)
- M3 expansion inserts
- M3 screws (countersink)
- 2.5mm cable ties

## Assembly

M3 expansion inserts go in the four holes in the main case, and the four holes
in the HQ camera main case.

5mm fan screws on to the bottom of the main case. Feed the wire through the main
round hole.

The Raspberry Pi sits on 6mm standoffs screwed through base of case. The wire
for the fan should go around the end with the SD card. That connects to a 5v
GPIO pin and GND.

Switch connects to GPIO17 and GND. Panel mounts in one of the two holes

3.5mm jack connects to 5v, GND and GPIO21 for the NeoPixel ring.

3.5mm male to bare end gets soldered onto the NeoPixel ring (through the LED
ring 3d printed part). There are a pair of holes for cable tying the cable to
the ring to protect from stress.

HQ Camera sits on 6mm standoffs in its own case. This then screws through the
top of the main case, with the tripod mount facing the same way as the HDMI

Front of the HQ case screws on to that, and then the lens attaches. The LED ring
3d printed part slides onto the end of the telephoto lens.

The whole lot screws together with the M3 screws.
